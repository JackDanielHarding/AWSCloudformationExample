## Notes

Even though it isn't in the cloudfomration script I included the S3 bucket from the description of the project which isn't in the requirements or rubric.
Theoretically because I have the NAT Gateway and the Route Table & Security Groups around the EC2 instances allow outbound traffic the EC2s could access content from the s3 buckets for the website
